# Django Backend Development Plan for SkillBuddy App

## Project Overview

SkillBuddy is a service marketplace mobile application that connects customers with service providers. This Django backend serves the Flutter mobile application located at `D:\Flutter Projects\flutter_skillbuddy_app\`.

### Flutter App Analysis Summary

**Architecture**: Flutter app uses Riverpod for state management with Freezed for immutable data classes and JSON serialization.

**Core Features Identified**:
- Dual user types (customers and service providers)
- Service marketplace with categories and discovery
- Complete booking system with scheduling
- Multi-payment options (immediate, later, installments, credits)
- Provider dashboard with earnings and job management
- Rating and review system
- Location-based service discovery
- Real-time chat system
- Multi-language support (English, German, Italian)

**User Flows**:
- Authentication: Email/password, social login, phone verification
- Customer: Service browsing → Provider selection → Booking → Payment → Management
- Provider: Registration → Dashboard → Job management → Earnings tracking
